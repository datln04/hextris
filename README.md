## üéØ How to Play

### Objective
Stack falling blocks and clear complete rows around the hexagonal grid to score points and survive as long as possible.

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**: Rotate the hexagon left and right
- **Mouse/Touch**: Tap/click on the sides to rotate
- **Mobile**: Swipe left or right to rotate the hexagon

### Game Mechanics

1. **Falling Blocks**: Colored blocks fall from the top toward the center of the hexagon
2. **Rotation**: Rotate the entire hexagonal grid to position blocks where you want them
3. **Line Clearing**: When a complete row is formed around any ring of the hexagon, it disappears
4. **Scoring**: Earn points for each line cleared - multiple lines cleared at once give bonus points
5. **Speed**: The game gets faster as you progress
6. **Game Over**: The game ends when blocks reach the center of the hexagon

### Tips & Strategy
- **Plan Ahead**: Look at the upcoming blocks and plan your moves
- **Clear Multiple Lines**: Try to set up multiple line clears for higher scores
- **Stay Calm**: As the game speeds up, focus on placement rather than speed
- **Use the Rotation**: The hexagonal rotation is your main tool - master it!
- **Watch the Center**: Keep the center area clear as long as possible
